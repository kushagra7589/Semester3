Summary of the midsem demo:
	1.Told to make a docker platform where user can give their image you have to create a container for their site.
	2.No need of making a LDAP site with google authentication

Progress after midsem demo
	1.After midsem demo implemented a Django app which takes input a image from user and host it on a docker container using docker-py API.
	2.The User can host multiple images on docker,can view list of all the containers,running container and exited containers.Also we give the functionality of start,stop,pass,unpause and delete a 	container to user.

Unfinished task:
	In our Django app we take image from the user which already conatins a Dockerfile.So we were unable to produce Docker file of each image given by user.
